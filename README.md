This is a college project (BINUS University) on a subject named "Human & Computer Interaction", where we aim to create an app prototype based on real-world problems.
The project is about creating a far better UI and user experience for reading news articles, when compared to other news platforms out there.

Do note that the features implied in the project are not really complete or fleshed out, as they only serve for demonstration purposes :D
